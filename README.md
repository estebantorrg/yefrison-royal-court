## Main Features
*   A fully styled and responsive static website featuring the biography and gallery of Sir Yuleinis.
*   Clean, stable, and professionally deployed code.

## The Development Journey
This project was a masterclass in the real-world software lifecycle.

1.  **Initial Vision:** To build a complex site with a live AI chatbot.
2.  **Deployment Failure:** The initial version, which worked locally, failed to deploy due to complexities in managing server-side API keys in a static hosting environment. This was a critical "breaking change."
3.  **Strategic Rollback:** Instead of abandoning the project, I made the engineering decision to roll back to a simpler, 100% stable, client-side version.
4.  **Refactoring & Hotfixing:** I worked with AI-assisted tools to debug, refactor, and polish the stable version.
5.  **Successful Deployment:** The refactored version was successfully deployed to production via Netlify.

## Technologies Used
*   HTML5 / CSS3
*   JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)
*   **Deployment:** Netlify
*   **Workflow:** AI-Assisted Development, Debugging, and Rollback Strategy

## Key Takeaway
The most important lesson from this project was not technical, but strategic: **a simple, stable, and SHIPPED product is infinitely more valuable than a complex but broken one.** This experience taught me the importance of deployment pipelines, risk management (rollbacks), and the resilience required to see a project through to production.
